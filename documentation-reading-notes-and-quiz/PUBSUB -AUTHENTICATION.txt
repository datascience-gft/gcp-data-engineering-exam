+ Service accounts

Service accounts are recommended for almost all use cases, whether you are developing locally or in a production application. For an example of how to set up authentication with a service account, see Pub/Sub client libraries.


You can authenticate users directly to your application, when the application needs to access resources on behalf of an end user. For most use cases, we recommend using a service account instead.

Examples of why to use user accounts with Cloud Pub/Sub include:

    Administrative actions

    Note that identity information is captured in audit logs.

If your application uses end user authentication, you need to specify OAuth scopes when making a method call.


+ Access control

Pub/Sub uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) for access control.

In Pub/Sub, access control can be configured at the project level and at the individual resource level. For example:

    Grant access on a per-topic or per-subscription basis, rather than for the whole Cloud project.
    Grant access with limited capabilities, such as to only publish messages to a topic, or to only consume messages from a subscription, but not to delete the topic or subscription.
    Grant access to all Pub/Sub resources within a project to a group of developers.


Every Pub/Sub method requires the caller to have the necessary permissions. For a list of the permissions and roles Pub/Sub Cloud IAM supports
