The BigQuery Data Transfer Service automates data movement into BigQuery on a scheduled, managed basis.
After you configure a data transfer, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service automatically loads data into BigQuery on a regular basis.
Currently, you cannot use the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to transfer data out of BigQuery.

Like BigQuery, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service is a multi-regional resource, with many additional single regions available.

When you set up a transfer, the transfer configuration itself is set to the same location as the destination dataset.
