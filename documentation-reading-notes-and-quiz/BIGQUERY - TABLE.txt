When copying multiple source tables to a destination table all source tables must have identical schemas.

When exporting table data, the only supported destination is Cloud Storage.

Quotas and limits apply to the different types of jobs you can run against tables, including:
    Loading data into tables (load jobs)
    Exporting data from tables (export jobs)
    Querying table data (query jobs)
    Copying tables (copy jobs)

your charges are based 
(1) on how much data is stored in the tables and partitions and 
(2) on the queries you run against the table data:

Many table operations are free, including 
	loading, 
	copying, 
	exporting data. 

Creating and update a table, permissions:

    bigquery.dataEditor
    bigquery.dataOwner
    bigquery.admin

Creating a table that references an external data source

An external data source (also known as a federated data source) is a data source that you can query directly even though the data is not stored in BigQuery. 
Instead of loading or streaming the data, you create a table that references the external data source.

BigQuery offers support for querying data directly from:

    Bigtable
    Cloud Storage
    Google Drive

You can query data in a supported external data source by creating a temporary or permanent table that references data stored in the external data source.

When you load data into BigQuery, you can: 
	load data into a new table or partition, 
	append data to an existing table or partition, 
	overwrite a table or partition. 

Controlling access to tables

You cannot assign access controls directly to tables or views. 
The lowest level of BigQuery resources to which you are able to grant access is the dataset level. 
To configure access to tables and views, you grant a Cloud IAM role to an entity at the dataset level or higher.
