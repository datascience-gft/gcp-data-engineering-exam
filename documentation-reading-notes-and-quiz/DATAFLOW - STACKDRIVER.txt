Stackdriver Monitoring provides powerful logging and diagnostics. 

Dataflow integration with Monitoring lets you access Dataflow job metrics such as 
	Job Status, 
	Element Counts, 
	System Lag (for streaming jobs), 
	and User Counters 
from the Monitoring dashboards. 

You can also employ Monitoring alerting capabilities to notify you of various conditions, such as long streaming system lag or failed jobs.

Dataflow reports incremental updates to Monitoring approximately every 30 seconds. 

Custom metrics are limited to 500 metrics per project.
