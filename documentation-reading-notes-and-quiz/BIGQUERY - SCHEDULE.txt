You can schedule queries to run on a recurring basis. 

Scheduled queries must be written in <<standard SQL>>, which can include 
	Data Definition Language (DDL) 
	Data Manipulation Language (DML) 
statements. 

The query string and destination table can be parameterized, 
allowing you to organize query results by date and time.

Before you create a scheduled query:

    Scheduled queries use features of the BigQuery Data Transfer Service.

Query string

The query string must be valid and written in standard SQL. 
Each run of a scheduled query can receive the following query parameters.

To manually test a query string with 
	@run_time 
	@run_date 
parameters before scheduling a query, use the command line interface.

+ permissions

Ensure that the person creating the transfer has the following required permissions in BigQuery:

    bigquery.transfers.update - create the transfer
    bigquery.datasets.update - on the target dataset

When you set up the scheduled query, if the destination table for your results doesn't exist, 
BigQuery attempts to create the table for you.

You can set up a scheduled query to authenticate with a service account. 
A service account is a Google Account associated with your GCP project. 
The service account can run jobs associated with its own service credentials, 
rather than an end-user's credentials, such as a batch processing pipeline, or a scheduled query.
