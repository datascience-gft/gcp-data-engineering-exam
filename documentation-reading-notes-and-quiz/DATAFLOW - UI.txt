When you execute your pipeline using the Dataflow managed service, you can view that job and any others by using Dataflow's web-based monitoring user interface. 

The monitoring interface lets you see and interact with your Dataflow jobs.

The monitoring interface can show you:

    A list of all currently running Dataflow jobs and previously run jobs within the last 30 days.
    A graphical representation of each pipeline.
    Details about your job's status, execution, and SDK version.
    Links to information about the Google Cloud services running your pipeline, such as Compute Engine and Cloud Storage.
    Any errors or warnings that occur during a job.
