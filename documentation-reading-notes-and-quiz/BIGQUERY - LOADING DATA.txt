You can load data:

    From Cloud Storage
    From other Google services, such as Google Ad Manager and Google Ads
    From a readable data source (such as your local machine)
    By inserting individual records using streaming inserts
    Using DML statements to perform bulk inserts
    Using a BigQuery I/O transform in a Dataflow pipeline to write data to BigQuery

Loading data into BigQuery from Google Drive is not currently supported.

Limitations

    Currently, you can load data into BigQuery only from Cloud Storage 
    or a readable data source (such as your local machine).

BigQuery supports loading data from Cloud Storage and readable data sources in the following formats:

    Cloud Storage:
        Avro
        CSV
        JSON (newline delimited only)
        ORC
        Parquet
        Datastore exports
        Firestore exports

    Readable data source (such as your local machine):
        Avro
        CSV
        JSON (newline delimited only)
        ORC
        Parquet


BigQuery supports UTF-8 encoding for both nested or repeated and flat data. 
BigQuery supports ISO-8859-1 encoding for flat data only for CSV files.

Optionally, you can explicitly specify the encoding when you import your data 
so that BigQuery can properly convert your data to UTF-8 during the import process. 

+ Loading compressed and uncompressed data

The Avro binary format is the preferred format for loading both compressed and uncompressed data. 
Avro data is faster to load because the data can be read in parallel, even when the data blocks are compressed. 

Parquet binary format is also a good choice because Parquet's efficient, 
per-column encoding typically results in a better compression ratio and smaller files. 

The ORC binary format offers benefits similar to the benefits of the Parquet format.

For other data formats such as CSV and JSON, 
BigQuery can load uncompressed files significantly faster than compressed files 
because uncompressed files can be read in parallel. 

+ Loading denormalized, nested, and repeated data

BigQuery performs best when your data is denormalized.

you can improve performance by denormalizing your data and taking advantage of nested and repeated fields.

+ Schema auto-detection

You can use schema auto-detection when you load JSON or CSV files.
Schema auto-detection is not available for Avro files, ORC files, Parquet files, Datastore exports, or Firestore exports
