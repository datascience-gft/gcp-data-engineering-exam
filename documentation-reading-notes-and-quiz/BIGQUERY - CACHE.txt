BigQuery writes all query results to a table. 

The table is either 
	a destination table, 
	a temporary, 
	cached results table. 

Temporary, cached results tables are maintained per-user, per-project. 

There are no storage costs for temporary tables, 
but if you write query results to a permanent table, you are charged for storing the data.

All query results, including both interactive and batch queries, 
are cached in temporary tables for approximately 24 hours 
with some exceptions.


run a <duplicate> query, will reuse cached results. 
the duplicate query text <must be exactly the same> as the original query.

For query results to persist in a cached results table, the result set must be smaller than the maximum response size.

you should not submit query jobs that retrieve results from the cache table. 
Instead, write your results to a named destination table. 
To enable easy cleanup, features such as 
	the dataset level <defaultTableExpirationMs> property
can expire the data automatically after a given duration.

When query results are retrieved from a cached results table, the job statistics property 

	statistics.query.cacheHit 

returns as true, and you are not charged for the query.

Query results are not cached:

    When a <<<destination table>>> is specified.
    If any of the referenced tables or logical views have <changed> 
    recently received <<streaming inserts>> (a streaming buffer is attached to the table) 
    query uses non-deterministic functions; for example, 
	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() 
	NOW() 
	CURRENT_USER() 
    return different values depending on when a query is executed
    querying multiple tables using <<<wildcard>>>
    cached results have <<expired>>.
    runs against an external data source

When you run a query, a temporary, cached results table is created in a special dataset referred to as 
	an "anonymous dataset". 
Unlike regular datasets which inherit permissions from the IAM resource hierarchy model (project and organization permissions), 
access to anonymous datasets is restricted to the dataset owner. 
The owner of an anonymous dataset is the user who ran the query that produced the cached result.

When an anonymous dataset is created, the user that runs the query job is explictly given 
	bigquery.dataOwner access 
to the anonymous dataset.

The 
	Use cached results 
option reuses results from a previous run of the same query 
unless 
	the tables being queried have changed. 

Using cached results is only beneficial for repeated queries. 

For new queries, the Use cached results option has no effect, 
though it is enabled by default.
