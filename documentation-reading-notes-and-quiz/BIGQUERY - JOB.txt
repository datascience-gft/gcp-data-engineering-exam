BigQuery jobs

Jobs are actions that BigQuery runs on your behalf to load data, export data, query data, or copy data. 

You can also programmatically create a load, export, query, or copy job. When you create a job programmatically, BigQuery schedules and runs the job for you.

Permission:
    bigquery.user
    bigquery.jobUser
    bigquery.admin

Every job is associated with a specific project that you specify.

The billing account attached to the associated project is billed for any usage incurred by the job.

To run a BigQuery job programmatically using the REST API or client libraries, you:

    Call the jobs.insert method using a unique job ID that is generated by your client code


When a job is submitted, it can be in one of three states:
    PENDING — scheduled
    RUNNING
    DONE
