Dataflow templates allow you to stage your pipelines on Cloud Storage and run them from a variety of environments. You can use one of the Google-provided templates or create your own.

Templates provide you with additional benefits compared to traditional Dataflow deployment, such as:

    Running your pipeline does not require you to recompile your code every time.
    You can run your pipelines without the development environment and associated dependencies that are common with traditional deployment. This is useful for scheduling recurring batch jobs.
    Runtime parameters allow you to customize the execution of the pipeline.
    Non-technical users can run templates with 
	the Google Cloud Console, 
	gcloud command-line tool, 
	the REST API.
