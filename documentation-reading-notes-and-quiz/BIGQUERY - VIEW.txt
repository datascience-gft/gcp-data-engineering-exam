BigQuery views are subject to the following limitations:

    The dataset, view,tables referenced by the view must be in the same <location>.
    cannot exports data from a view.
    A standard SQL query cannot reference a view defined using legacy SQL syntax.
    You cannot reference query parameters in views.
    The schemas of the underlying tables are stored with the view when the view is created.
    You cannot include a user-defined function in the SQL query that defines a view.
    You cannot reference a view in a wildcard table query.


You cannot assign access controls directly to tables or views. 
The lowest level of BigQuery resources to which you are able to grant access is the dataset level. 

+ authorized views

Giving a view access to a dataset is also known as creating an authorized view in BigQuery. 
An authorized view allows you to share query results with particular users and groups without giving them access to the underlying tables. 
You can also use the view's SQL query to restrict the columns (fields) the users are able to query.

IMPORTANT:
When you create the view, it must be created in a dataset <separate> from the source data queried by the view.
Because you can assign access controls only at the dataset level
