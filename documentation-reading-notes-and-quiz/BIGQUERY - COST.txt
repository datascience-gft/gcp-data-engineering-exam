On-demand queries are charged based on the number of bytes read. 

To estimate costs before running a query use the:

    Query validator in the Cloud Console or the classic BigQuery web UI
    --dry_run flag in the CLI
    dryRun parameter when submitting a query job using the API
    Google Cloud Pricing Calculator
    Client libraries


If you have multiple BigQuery projects and users, 
you can manage costs by requesting a custom quota that specifies a limit on the amount of query data processed per day.

Creating a custom quota on query data allows you to control costs at the 
	project 
	user
level.

    Project-level custom quotas limit the aggregate usage of all users in that project.

    User-level custom quotas are separately applied to each user or service account within a project.

After you set a custom quota, BigQuery returns an error when you exceed it.

What if I exceeded my custom quota, but I want to reset it?

You can run your query from another project that has access to your datasets and that doesn't have a custom quota or hasn't yet exceeded it.
