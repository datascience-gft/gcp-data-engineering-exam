An external data source 
	(also known as a federated data source) 
is a data source that you can query directly even though the data is not stored in BigQuery. 

Instead of loading or streaming the data, you create a table that references the external data source.

BigQuery offers support for querying data directly from:

    Bigtable
    Cloud Storage
    Google Drive

Use cases for external data sources include:

    Loading and cleaning your data in one pass by querying the data from an external data source 
    (a location external to BigQuery) and writing the cleaned result into BigQuery storage.

    Having a small amount of frequently changing data that you join with other tables. 
    As an external data source, the frequently changing data does not need to be reloaded every time it is updated.

+ limitations

	BigQuery does not guarantee data consistency for external data sources. 
	Changes to the underlying data while a query is running can result in unexpected behavior

	Query performance for external data sources may not be as high as querying data in a native BigQuery table. 	If query speed is a priority, load the data into BigQuery instead of setting up an external data source. 
	The performance of a query that includes an external data source depends on the external storage type. 
	For example, querying data stored in Cloud Storage is faster than querying data stored in Google Drive. 

	You cannot run a BigQuery job that exports data to an external data source.

	You cannot reference an external data source in a wildcard table query.

	External data sources do not support table partitioning or clustering.

	When you query an external data source, the results are not cached.
	You are charged for each query against an external table even if you issue the same query multiple times. 
	If you need to repeatedly issue a query against an external table that does not change frequently, 
	consider writing the query results to a permanent table 
	and run the queries against the permanent table instead.

	You are limited to 4 concurrent queries against a Cloud Bigtable external data source.

+ Location considerations

	Colocate your BigQuery dataset and your external data source.
		When you query data in an external data source such as Cloud Storage, 
		the data you're querying must be in the same location as your BigQuery dataset.


To manually move a dataset from one location to another, follow this process:

    1. Export the data from your BigQuery tables to a regional or multi-region Cloud Storage bucket 
    in the same location as your dataset. 
    There are no charges for exporting data from BigQuery, 
    but you do incur charges for storing the exported data in Cloud Storage. 
    BigQuery exports are subject to the limits on export jobs.

    2. Copy or move the data from your Cloud Storage bucket to a regional or multi-region bucket in the new location. 

    3. After you transfer the data to a Cloud Storage bucket in the new location, create a new BigQuery dataset 
    (in the new location). Then, load your data from the Cloud Storage bucket into BigQuery.
    You are not charged for loading the data into BigQuery, 
    but you will incur charges for storing the data in Cloud Storage until you delete the data or the bucket. 
    You are also charged for storing the data in BigQuery after it is loaded.
