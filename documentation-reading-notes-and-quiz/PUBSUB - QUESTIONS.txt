The easiest and recommended way for most users to use Pub/Sub is with our provided __________. 

If you are an advanced user and our client libraries don't meet your specific needs, 
you can also develop your own client libraries to directly access Pub/Sub's REST/HTTP and gRPC interfaces.


PUBLISHER


Pub/Sub offers __________ message delivery and best-effort _______ to existing subscribers


When using JSON over REST, message data must be __________ encoded.

The entire request including one or more messages must be smaller than ___, after decoding. 

Note that the message payload must not be empty; it must contain either a non-empty _________, or at least one _______.

can publish messages synchronously or asynchronously. 
Asynchronous publishing allows for batching and higher __________ in your application.

The Pub/Sub client libraries batch multiple messages into a single call to the service. 
The cost of batching is _______ for individual messages

Response:

200 OK

{
  "messageIds": [
    "19916711285"
  ]
}

To minimize latency, batching should be turned off. 
This is particularly important for applications that publish a single message as part of a request-response sequence. 
A common example of this pattern is encountered in s______, e____-d______ applications using _______ or ________.



Publishing failures are automatically retried, except for errors that do not warrant retries.

Retry settings control both the total number of _______ and ________ backoff.
The initial RPC timeout is the time the client waits for the initial RPC to succeed before retrying.
The total timeout is the time the client waits before it stops retrying.
Once the first RPC fails or times out, the _______ backoff logic determines when the subsequent retries occur. 



SUBSCRIBER


To receive messages published to a topic, you must create a _______ to that topic. 

Pub/Sub delivers each published message _______ for every subscription.

a message that cannot be delivered within the maximum retention time of ______ is deleted and is no longer accessible.

Once a message is sent to a subscriber, the subscriber should ______ the message. 

Pub/Sub will repeatedly attempt to deliver any message that has not been ______. 

While a message is outstanding to a subscriber, however, Pub/Sub tries not to ______________________________ on the same subscription. 

You can achieve exactly once processing of Pub/Sub message streams using the ____________ programming model. The ______ I/O connectors lets you interact with Cloud Dataflow via controlled ______ and ______ connector. 
You can use the ______ PubSubIO connector (for Java and Python) to read from Cloud Pub/Sub. 



+ Pull subscription

In pull delivery, your <subscriber application initiates requests> to the Pub/Sub server to retrieve messages.

+ Push subscription

In push delivery, Pub/Sub initiates requests to your subscriber application to deliver messages.

The Pub/Sub server sends each message as an HTTPS request to the subscriber application at a pre-configured ______.

Pull 	

    Large volume of messages (many more than 1/second).
    ______ and ______ of message processing is critical.
    Public HTTPS ______, with non-self-signed ______, is not feasible to set up.

Push	

    Multiple topics that must be processed by the same webhook.
    ______ Standard and ____________ subscribers.


By default, subscriptions expire after 31 days of inactivity



PULL


Using asynchronous pulling provides ____________ in your application, by not requiring your application to block for new messages.

Your subscriber client might process and acknowledge messages more slowly than Pub/Sub sends them to the client.

More generally, the need for flow control indicates that messages are being published at a higher rate than they are being consumed. If this is a persistent state, rather than a transient spike in message volume, consider increasing the number of subscriber client instances.


When you do not acknowledge a message before its __________________ has expired, Pub/Sub resends the message. 
As a result, Pub/Sub can send duplicate messages.

 To reduce the duplication rate, extend the message deadline.

    Client libraries handle deadline extension automatically, but you should note that there are default limits on the maximum extension deadline that can be configured.
    If you are building your own client library, use the ____________ method to extend the acknowledgement deadline.


PUSH


A Pub/Sub subscription can be configured to send all messages as an HTTP POST requests to a webhook, a push endpoint, URL. 

For push subscriptions, Pub/Sub does not send a negative acknowledgment (sometimes known as a nack). 

If your webhook does not return a ____________, Pub/Sub retries delivery until the message expires after the subscription's ____________ period.

Automatic authentication and authorization mechanisms are available for App Engine Standard and Cloud Functions endpoints hosted in the same project as the subscription.


SUB REPLAY and PURGE


Normally, acknowledged messages are inaccessible to subscribers of a given subscription. 
In addition, subscriber clients must process every message in a subscription even if only a subset is needed.

The Seek feature extends subscriber functionality by allowing you to alter the acknowledgement state of messages in bulk. 
For example, you can replay previously acknowledged messages or purge messages in bulk.

+ Seeking to a ____________

Seeking to a time marks every message received by Pub/Sub before the time as acknowledged, and all messages received after the time as unacknowledged. 
You can seek to a time in the future to purge messages. 
To replay and reprocess previously acknowledged messages, seek to a prior time. 

+ Seeking to a ____________

The ____________ feature allows you to capture the message acknowledgment state of a subscription. Once a ____________ is created, it retains

+ Eventual consistency

Seek operations are strictly consistent in regard to message delivery guarantees. 
This means that any message that is to become unacknowledged based on the seek condition is guaranteed to be eventually delivered at least once after the seek operation succeeds.


+ Use cases

    Update subscriber code safely. 
    Recover from unexpected subscriber problems. 
    Save processing time and cost.
    Test subscriber code on known data. 





In Pub/Sub, access control can be configured at the ____________ level and at the ____________ level. For example:

    Grant access on a per-______ or per-s______ basis, rather than for the whole Cloud project.
    Grant access with limited capabilities, such as to only publish messages to a topic, or to only consume messages from a subscription, but not to delete the topic or subscription.
    Grant access to all Pub/Sub resources within a project to a group of developers.

Service accounts are recommended for almost all use cases, whether you are developing locally or in a production application. For an example of how to set up authentication with a service account, see Pub/Sub client libraries.



Pub/Sub encrypts messages with Google-managed keys by default.

You can also use the Stackdriver ______ API to query and view metrics for subscriptions and topics.

At the application layer, Pub/Sub individually encrypts incoming messages as soon as the message is received. 

Every message is encrypted at the following states and layers:
    At rest
    In transit
